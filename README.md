| ðŸª“    | Prepare drives for Chia Farming                                                                   | Before you start farming Chia, you'll need to prepare your hard drives. This involves partitioning, formatting, and creating plots on them. To do this efficiently, you can use scripts such as `prepare-drives.sh` to automate the process. These scripts allow you to set the number of plots to create, the size of the plots, and other parameters to optimize the plotting process. The `prepare-drives.sh` script is very powerful and potentially dangerous, so it's important to understand what it does and use it carefully. The script formats the specified drives with an ext4 file system, sets reserve space to 0%, disables write-cache, and optimizes read-ahead caching for performance. The script also powers off the drive to finalize the `hdparm` commands. Make sure to only run this script on drives that are dedicated to Chia farming and not used for any other purposes.|
| ðŸŒ±    | Create Bladebit Plots                                                                            | The Bladebit algorithm is a plotting algorithm for Chia that is faster than the CPU-based plotting algorithms and doesn't require CUDA. To create Bladebit plots, you can use the `bladebit-plotting.sh` script. The script runs a Docker container that is configured with the necessary environment variables to create Bladebit plots efficiently. You'll need to fill in your CONTRACT and FARMERKEY to generate plots. Once you have filled in the required information, you can run the script to create plots with 512GB of memory. The container exposes port 80, which allows you to access the file explorer at port 80. This can be useful for managing and organizing your plots. With Bladebit plots, you can potentially earn more rewards and speed up your Chia farming operation.
| ðŸšœ    | Create C7 Bladebit GPU Plots                                                                      | If you have a compatible GPU and want to create C7 Bladebit plots, you can use the `bladebit-cuda-plotting.sh` script instead. This script can help you create C7 plots efficiently by optimizing the use of your GPU and ensuring that your plots are created with the right parameters. To update the `bladebit-cuda-plotting.sh` script, you'll need to check for any new updates or changes to the script and update it accordingly. With C7 plots, you can further accelerate your Chia farming and potentially earn more rewards. |
| ðŸŒ¾    | Farm Bladebit GPU Plots                                                                           | Once you've created your plots, you'll need to start farming them to earn rewards. To do this, you'll need to run a full node of the Chia blockchain on your computer and point it to your plots. The `Chia` software is the most popular choice for this and can be downloaded from the official Chia website. Alternatively, you can use `harvester-compose.yml` to configure a Docker container to farm plots. This can be a convenient way to manage your Chia farming operation, especially if you have multiple hard drives or want to automate the process. With a full node or harvester container running, you can start farming your plots and wait for the rewards to roll in. Note that farming Chia requires a lot of disk space, so make sure you have enough hard drive space to accommodate your plots.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

To move plots efficiently, you can use the `plot-mover.sh` script. If you haven't created this script yet, you can use the code provided to create it. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated file transfer tool such as `FileZilla
