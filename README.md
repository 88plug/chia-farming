| ðŸª“    | Prepare drives for Chia Farming                                                                   | Before you start farming Chia, you'll need to prepare your hard drives. This involves partitioning, formatting, and creating plots on them. To do this efficiently, you can use scripts such as `prepare-drives.sh` to automate the process. These scripts allow you to set the number of plots to create, the size of the plots, and other parameters to optimize the plotting process. To update the `prepare-drives.sh` script, you'll need to check for any new updates or changes to the script and update it accordingly. With the right preparation, you can ensure that your drives are ready to go for farming and maximize your chances of success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ðŸŒ±    | Create Bladebit Plots                                                                            | The Bladebit algorithm is a plotting algorithm for Chia that doesn't require CUDA. It's faster than the CPU-based plotting algorithms and can help you create plots more quickly. To create Bladebit plots, you can use the `bladebit-plotting.sh` script. This script can help you create plots efficiently by optimizing the use of your CPU and ensuring that your plots are created with the right parameters. To update the `bladebit-plotting.sh` script, you'll need to check for any new updates or changes to the script and update it accordingly. With Bladebit plots, you can speed up your Chia farming and potentially earn more rewards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This script can help you create C7 plots efficiently by optimizing the use of your GPU and ensuring that your plots are created with the right parameters. To update the `bladebit-cuda-plotting.sh` script, you'll need to check for any new updates or changes to the script and update it accordingly. With C7 plots, you can further accelerate your Chia farming and potentially earn more rewards. |

To do this, you'll need to run a full node of the Chia blockchain on your computer and point it to your plots. The `Chia` software is the most popular choice for this and can be downloaded from the official Chia website. Alternatively, you can use `harvester-compose.yml` to configure a Docker container to farm plots. This can be a convenient way to manage your Chia farming operation, especially if you have multiple hard drives or want to automate the process. With a full node or harvester container running, you can start farming your plots and wait for the rewards to roll in. Note that farming Chia requires a lot of disk space, so make sure you have enough hard drive space to accommodate your plots.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

To move plots efficiently, you can use the `plot-mover.sh` script. If you haven't created this script yet, you can use the code provided to create it. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated file transfer tool such as `FileZilla
